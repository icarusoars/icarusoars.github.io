        <title>Bread, Butter, &amp; Python Data Structures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was Leetcoding a few days earlier, I realized I have spent so much time with Pandas &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dataframes&lt;/code&gt; and Numpy &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arrays&lt;/code&gt; that I was relatively unfamiliar with Python’s built-in data structures. So here’s an “everything” article on Python data structures. The hope is that after reading and digesting this article, we can Leetcode faster without searching up &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;’s API every 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will not be another documentation of Python Data Structures. I will not talk about every single API of the Data structures. Only the APIs that are important will be mentioned. Examples of using these Data Structures to solve a toy-problem will be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each data structure, I will talk about these 5 categories for the data structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initializing Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessing Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manipulating Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Converting to other Data Structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, here is a semantic tree of how Data Structures are organized in Python. The semantic tree shows only the Data Structures we care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-no-import-data-structures&quot;&gt;The No-Import Data Structures&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;list&quot;&gt;List&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is what is more commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;Array&lt;/strong&gt; in python. It stores a sequence of items that can be accessed through its indices.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;set&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Did you know you can Intern at the NBA?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can intern at the NBA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I sure did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not even remotely think about working there until a good friend of mine, Wesley, told me about the internship application. I applied, got in, and the rest was history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as I am sitting back and writing this article, it blows my mind that I interned at &lt;strong&gt;THE friking NBA&lt;/strong&gt;. It blows my mind because the NBA has always been a huge part of my identity that I grew up with. It’s almost like another friend to me, being with me through my ups and my downs, my wins and my losses. I built my character after stories I learned of NBA stars because they were my very first idea of success and happiness. I don’t fist pump at raves but I sure do when a buzzer-beater goes in. And I usually stay on the quiet side of things, but I can get very hyped up playing basketball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../pictures/posts/NBA_intern/nba2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Group Pic!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-basketball-means-to-me&quot;&gt;What Basketball Means to Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kind of put things into perspective, I wrote about what basketball means to me here. Ehh it kinda got a little long. Skip to the next heading to learn just about the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a fond memory. As a high-schooler, I went to a rather strict school in China with no WIFI. Whenever playoffs time came though, my friends and I would have our phones out underneath our desks, and use this app called 虎扑 to text-stream playoffs games. Yes, text-stream. On our limited data plans, we would read the game play-by-play. That’s how much we loved the game. We would be half-heartedly scribbling out some math formulas when in actuality our eyes were wandering to that small phone screen for the amazing game happening on the other side of the globe. And when a game-winning shot goes in, you can bet all the boys in the class will simultaneously flip over the desks, scare our math-teacher to death and celebrate like crazy. Of course, the poor dude with data lag would try to ask which team won amidst the celebration but join in too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the countless fond memories I made on the court, through the game, that have persisted to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my primary school years, my classmates and I would get off school and rush to the Chinese Athletic Agency. Apparently our moms got us a deal to train with the professional kids to fill in some training reps. It was hard work. There may or may not have been puking on the tracks after 800 meters of frog jumps, but those were some of the happiest and most carefree years of basketball for me. I developed all my fundamentals then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enrolled into international school for middle school and had even more time for basketball. I think every kid had different middle-school-kid goals then, but the basketball kids only had one – sprint to the cafeteria to secure 2 hamburgers before the lines could form and then bring them to the court to maximize our playing time during lunch. Talk to girls during lunch? No thank you. Basketball was life. I think my mom became seriously worried I would get appendicitis at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High school came and a coach of ours by the name of “Handsome Thunder” (literal translation from Chinese) picked out some of us he thought were good at basketball. He started training us and taking us to tournaments. He kickstarted our school’s non-existent organized basketball efforts at that time, and later on another coach would take it to new heights. We as the group of kids he picked out, started playing together more and then almost every chance we got. I remember all these guys so fondly. It was like yesterday I played with them and I still remember their tendencies. When I visited Wesley in LA a year back, we played one-on-one. I think we both smiled a bit when we found that our tendencies did not change much. It’s something very cool to recognize a bro by his brand of game. We reminisced high school basketball and how even once we did a one-on-one bet with the loser confessing to the girl he likes. Those were some good times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more basketball memories unfiled into the timeline told just now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HJJ was a basketball trainer who took me under his wing during a basketball summer camp. He is someone I respect so much because he bet everything on basketball. He has grand aspirations to be the best Point Guard in Shanghai, and yet he was so down-to-earth to talk basketball and life aspirations into the late night with a bunch of sweaty boys. I respect the non-professional players who do not outgrow the game. They stick with it. He’s become an elite trainer now for Nike and YBDL and is spreading the game of basketball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very good bro of mine came to me once after a huge break-up. We talked and had food, but before long, we took things to the basketball court. “You know what, screw things. It’s fine.” He said as he knocked down a jump-shot with focus. And that’s when I knew he was fine. To my friends who ask about my “Basketball is My Girlfriend” t-shirt, maybe that was the origin story of it. On that day, I realized basketball is a constant in the lives of many of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having gone to college, I would return to Shanghai and check out the shabby court nearby my house that I’d go every weekend. It was heartwarming to see the grandpa who gate-keeped the court was still around. I don’t think he recognizes me but I was glad to put the 2 Yuan court-entrance fee into the palm of his hands. All the ballers in the area love the guy because he kept the court clean and would sell us drinks so we could dominate on the courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s that. My story of basketball, the NBA, the game. I’m no professional player, but the game has given me so much joy and made me the person I am today. NBA and basketball has meant so much to me and been such a defining way of life, I never really thought I could get more from it, until I interned at the NBA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, here are some digestable bullet points of what I learned at the NBA that I wrote down during my internship. If you want to get a further idea of life at NBA, I’d be happy to talk in person some day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;G League Intern Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-giving-culture--nba&quot;&gt;The Giving Culture @ NBA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we were told repeatedly was that nobody gets to where they are just by themselves. Reach out to people who can help you, motivate you, teach you. Once you get to a better position, help, motivate, teach those who reach out to you. I love the culture of coffee chats at the NBA. People who have been on their journey longer than us interns were so willing to give time and insight to their journey and teach us what they know. My great time having coffee chats with all kinds of amazing NBA people was also a reminder to myself &lt;strong&gt;to give help and insight to those that can benefit from it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sal-wisdom&quot;&gt;Sal Wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a fireside chat with a Senior Leader of the NBA, Salvatore Larocca, President of Global Partnerships. It was my absolute favorite talk because as Sal sat at the front of the long desk with us interns crowded around him, he was able to tell us his life story in such a heartfelt and genuine manner. There really was no barrier between me and his story besides maybe all the intern heads popping out at the long desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I could tell, Sal always knew he wanted to be successful, and did whatever he could to ensure he was on the path of success. After all his stories, you can really tell he is successful and happy by holding to simple philosophies our current day-and-age may like to dismiss as reductionist. &lt;strong&gt;A simple “work hard and you’ll be successful” really meant a lot coming from him. My favorite quote from him is: “There’s going to be noise in your life because you are still young. The noise is 90% of life. Go and find the other 10%.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;byron-wisdom&quot;&gt;Byron Wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fireside chat we had was with Senior Leader Byron Spruell, President of League Operations. &lt;strong&gt;With the limited minutes we got with him, I kept on telling myself Byron is the type of leader I want to be.&lt;/strong&gt; I respect all the Senior Leaders all the same, but I could just tell Byron’s leadership style resounded with me the most. He had the commanding presence I think any good leader needs. But at the same time, he had the genuineness to make you feel right at home talking to him. It’s hard to describe. You’d have to meet him to know exactly what I mean. &lt;strong&gt;But in the meantime, here’s a great piece of advice from him: “Always have a personal board of directors around you.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byron’s been intentional with his career decisions. It’s important to recognize that your career is your own doing, and you should make sure you’re not drifting around in your career. The way Byron has done that is by running himself like how you run a company - with a board of directors. &lt;strong&gt;These are close friends, peers or even superiors you trust, who can give you their takes. You tell them your goals when you set them, and you report back to them the results when you achieve the goals. These board directors make sure you don’t make a biased decision by providing their opinions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Good Portion of the Asians&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-to-great&quot;&gt;Good to Great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a Data Analyst intern on the Digital Content Strategy team. With my manager being in charge of WNBA, G League, and Basketball Africa League social media data, I understood the disparities in size of these leagues with the NBA. Furthermore, with my intern project being about expanding G League opportunities, &lt;strong&gt;I was truly put in a position to think about how to take a business from good to great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure the NBA is a multi-billion league everyone tunes into now, but how do we take the WNBA, G League and BAL to that level? This was the most interesting overarching question to think about. Because even if these leagues’ market-sizes are capped lower than the NBA’s, the question of how do we make them leap into a different stratosphere of market-size is the million-dollar question. For our intern project, one member of our team, &lt;strong&gt;Alex was ripping his hair out to think of a good recommendation for the G League.&lt;/strong&gt; That was very inspirational to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../../../pictures/posts/NBA_intern/nba7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;High Quality Picture with Low Quality Tank&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-both-be-as-much-as-you-can&quot;&gt;Be Both! Be as much as you can!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bullet point is from the point of view of an engineer and for all the engineers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least at the University of Illinois, I truly feel engineers have been somewhat limited. What I mean by this is that we are great engineers, but we can be more than just engineers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through interning at the NBA, I’ve come to recognize the NBA rewards 2 types of people. &lt;strong&gt;The NBA rewards the hard-workers, the people who put their heads down and deliver amazing substance. The NBA also rewards charismatic leaders, the ones who can inspire play and call others to action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering people are definitely hard-workers, because it truly takes a lot of time to become a good engineer. And then it takes a lot of time to engineer a good product! However, at my time at the NBA, I was enabled to be more than an engineer. I was trusted to communicate results to peers and superiors, and present important ideas to others. My time there reminded me of my time as a debater in high school. I would use words to persuade and to inspire thought. The NBA was a reminder that I can use that ability of mine, along with engineering, to be so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess the very complicated point I am trying to make here is this: &lt;strong&gt;Be both! Both a good engineer and an inspiring character/leader.&lt;/strong&gt; The further takeaway for myself is: Time is limited, so be productive in working hard so I can have time to be with others to inspire and be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intern-culture&quot;&gt;Intern Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, lastly I’ll just list some of the top memories I had as an intern there. Most of these are insider stories so hopefully my intern friends will have a good laugh when they see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ice Cream Thursdays. The fast-break intern&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one-on-one of the summer. Instagram-lived&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Celtics, the Quiet Grind</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Boston Celtics fan, I watched their game against the Philadelphia 76ers with much enthusiasm. It seemed like the Celtics had a little too much fun at London the previous night and started the game slow, gradually letting up a lead as much as 22 points in the 2nd quarter. However, with some explosive scoring in the 3rd, they took the 76ers by storm and shut up Embiid and his programmed post-game trash talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how other Celtics fans felt when we fell down by 22 points, but I wasn’t worried the least bit. Granted, the 76ers tendency to not hold on to leads did help, but it was knowing that Boston has a quiet grind that takes teams by surprise that really helped me not worry. Sure, the Celtics were down quite a bit, but it was only because their shots were not falling. Boston was still executing like they always were, and I could sure tell from the eye-test that their grind was present despite having rested for a good 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is this Celtics quiet grind that I’m talking about? I’m talking about their great concentration and sticking to their game-plan even when things are not going their way in a game. I’m talking about not caring about all the narratives out there that they will fall to the Cavs in the Easter Conference Finals and just working on their craft. I’m talking about not being perturbed by trailing by 22 points to a borderline playoffs team and making that comeback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to deify the Celtics, but this quiet grind is a pretty rare team quality that you don’t see in many teams. However, with the Celtics if you look very closely and try to eye-test not just their game but their attitude, you can see it there when Tatum checks Brown back into the game when they’re still down and Tatum looks at Brown and Brown just nods, as if saying “I’ll take it from here, don’t worry.” You can see it when Kyrie goes to the bench looking down because he missed a lot of shots he normally makes and Brad Stevens just pats him and looks on, as if saying “Don’t worry, your teammates got you out there.” You can see it when Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart communicate on defense, and the very next possession Rozier gets a deflection and steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really helps with the type of leadership that Kyrie Irving is practicing with the Celtics. I would say that although Kyrie Irving is “the man” on the Celtics, he is not the bona fide leader in which every thing runs through him. This doesn’t make him anything less than a good leader though. Precisely, this bona fide leader all-encompassing leader figure -Lebron James is what Irving tried to avoid by coming to the Celtics. He is the number 1 option to go to when the Celtics need to make an important shot, but he is not the person who runs the entire show for the Celtics. I think this is really healthy for the Celtics because everyone feels important on the Celtics and everyone grinds with Irving. Otherwise the Celtics would just be about Kyrie Irving’s grind and proving to the world he is a leader. This type of unassuming of all success and failure leadership also takes a lot of mental load off of Irving, leaving him more mental room to grind for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have other team members looking after Kyrie Irving. When Kyrie lobbed that pass to Gordon Hayward that resulted in his season-ending injury, you could easily see that Kyrie was shaken up hard. As the lob was in the air I couldn’t help but say to myself “damn, this pass looks very dangerous!” so I can’t imagine how Irving felt about that pass. However, Al Horford came and took Irving under his wing, giving him an extensive talk about to not take it upon himself for Hayward’s injury. That moment defined Irving’s dynamic with the rest of the team. He is the leader who is the greatest factor in helping Boston succeed. However, at the same time, he can lean on his teammates who will support and protect him on this new journey of being the team leader. That’s what Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown did last year for Isaiah Thomas, and that’s what they are doing this year for Irving. Together, they grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think such a quiet grind characteristic that the Celtics have right now really takes teams by surprise, because they’re never amplifying what they don’t have yet. They’re not gonna go out and say “we’re gonna get this lead back and send this team back to their non-playoff bracket”. They’re just gonna go out and get them a stop or a basket play-by-play and see where to go from there. With the exception of Marcus Smart probably, none of the Celtics are loud players, but make no mistake, they are grinding. I write this article to let fans from other teams (especially Cavs fans) aware. Let the Celtics not take you by surprise soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Observations on Christmas Day — 76ers @ Knicks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first game of Christmas is the battle of the unicorns. There is no doubt that 76ers vs Knicks is a matchup designed for the two unicorns — Joel Embiid and Kristap Porzingis — to go at each other. However, besides the exciting end of first quarter one-on-one between the unicorns, both teams stuck to their defensive assignments for the most part, with Kanter guarding Embiid and Saric guarding Porzingis. That took much of the fun out of watching this game, but there were still many elements of the game that were interesting. Here are some observations I made during the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Observation 1: Joel Embiid has a smoother touch than Kristap Porzingis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristap Porzingis has a much more wirey body frame than Joel Embiid and seems a little bit shy of Embiid’s comfortableness finishing around the rim. Multiple times in this game, Porzingis could not lay the ball in after being fouled. He will definitely improve finishing around the rim as he gets stronger and improves his post moves so he can get closer to the rim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Observation 2: Ben Simmons is a player that needs the middle more so than anyone else&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Simmons is like a rookie Lebron. His point-forward playstyle is similar to that of Lebron in the sense that his predominant tendency is to drive into the paint and kick out to shooters or slashers after the defense has already shifted enough to be easily broken down. However, unlike Lebron who has an outside shot and knows the offense well enough to do backdoor cuts, Ben Simmons can only drive and kick. He can also finish, but unless he gets all the way to the rim, it is obvious he is reluctant to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, particularly in the 2nd quarter, the Knicks did a very good job forcing Simmons to go left instead of middle after Embiid set screens for him. Simmons drives were stopped properly and the weak side had the shooters covered properly so Simmons could only back out and hit Embiid in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems to me that although Simmons has huge gravity and attracts a lot of defenders, he won’t attract much if he doesn’t go middle. And since he is not yet comfortable finishing by himself unless he goes all the way to the rim, his orchestrating the offense just isn’t effective if he doesn’t drive middle. In short, Simmons should improve his finishing, and in the mean time, drive middle to be able to distribute the weak side more. Brett Brown should also help him out by having the weak side move around more to get openings instead of expecting Simmons to be like Lebron and perform over-the-defense passes every possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Observation 3: Both teams don’t realize shot-creation potential of post-ups enough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both teams made it clear that hitting their unicorns in the post was a big part of their offense. For the 76ers, giving the ball to Embiid in the post is also their fallback plan if they can’t get anything going and the clock is running out. However, both teams should use the post-up to find shots for teammates more than they currently do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current NBA, teams like to shadow double team, where perimeter defenders shadow between their assignment and the post player and commits to a hard double team if the post player tries to finish. This entails that teammates on the perimeter will often have a few feet of room away from their defenders. Post-players should kick out to these teammates who have their defenders a few feet away from them more so that they can create something. More obviously, they should kick out to the weak-side teammates who are completely left open after defenses rotate to double team. Both Philadelphia and New York need to realize that their post players create many openings on the perimeter and to have their bigs find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Observation 4: T.J. McConnell shows the NBA isn’t just a Talent-driven league&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectively speaking, there is nothing about T.J. McConnell’s game that is special. As a point guard, he cannot get more than a half step ahead of his defender nor can he shoot the lights out on demand like the star point guards do in this league. However, with 15 points, 4 assists and a very important steal in the 4th, McConnell shows why he is a key rotational player in the league. With his height and wingspan, he never has much room to operate, but he always holds the reaching arms of the defenders off just enough to get a pass to a cutting teammate off. He always makes the right passes to the open teammates. And when he is open, he sure does knock his shots down. I just find it inspiring that there is so little room for error for a player like him, yet he performs so well. Granted, the league’s superstars will be the ones with the most talent, but McConnell very much shows that there is a place for players with less talent like him in the league by doing all the right things at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thunder @ 76ers: A tiring win for the Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing my CS final today, I tuned into the Thunder @ 76ers game on ESPN. It was going to be one of those games that I just watch some tidbits during dinner, but I left the TV on anyways. AND GOOD THING I DID. This game was one of the best games I watched this season — with the 76ers re-upping their lifeline 3 times to make 3 overtimes, this was a game my friends and I regret we didn’t make a game-night out of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the fans who didn’t tune into this game, the Thunder pulled out an almost comedic victory (Andre Roberson made the exact same under-the-rim shot he didn’t get a foul call on at the end of 2nd overtime) of 119–117. However, beyond the adrenaline rush for the clutch shots made over and over again by both teams, this game really confirms the ESPN talk-show narratives that are out there for me: “The Thunder still haven’t figured out their Big-3 and doesn’t look like they will before the trade deadline” and “the 76ers patiently stockpiling talent over the years is paying its dividends this season”. Even though the Thunder won, it wasn’t a pretty win. And even though the 76ers lost, it was a damn pretty loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, to me, it’s just pathetic how the Thunder are playing offense right now. On a night that Carmelo Anthony is shooting 64.7% from the field, the Thunder still played bad enough overall to have to contend 3 overtimes with the 76ers, who were absolutely gassed by the end of the 4th quarter. Yes, the rest of the Big-3, Westbrook (10 of 33) and Paul George (8 of 23), both had a rather bricky night, but the Thunder did so many other things right that they clearly were able to put the game away much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the Thunder contained Ben Simmons, the 76ers offense facilitator, very well this game. Paul George and Andre Roberson were able to use their length and defensive knowledge to pester Ben Simmons enough. I was amazed that OKC’s defense could get Ben Simmons to turn his back towards the rim to protect the ball and completely lose his attack mode. Ben Simmons still played a great game, but his contribution really died off near the end of regulation. He resorted to feeding Embiid in the post and just letting Embiid go at OKC. With Simmons playing more passively, this put a larger burden on Embiid and took away some of his game. Watching previous games, Embiid is a great pop-out shooter and even second driver. Simmons would often just use a screen to get to the middle, sucking in defenders and kicking it out to Embiid for a shot or second drive. However, with Simmons so afraid of getting the ball stolen by OKC, Embiid was really reduced to his post-game as he cannot create a pull-up shot nor initiate a drive with a defender right in front of him. OKC had less moving offensive pieces to defend and double-teamed Embiid with less risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, OKC pulled down 18 offensive rebounds, giving them 13 more possessions than the 76ers. Westbrook would just rush into the lane and snatch rebounds away from Robert Covington or JJ Redick who think they have already secured the defensive rebound in their hands. Also, Steven Adams had a great command of space and tapped out multiple loose balls for the team to stir up another attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was the problem for OKC? With great defense and many more second chance opportunities, why were they struggling so hard to put the game away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, tonight they didn’t put the ball in Carmelo’s hands when they should have been. One of the advantages of having a Big-3 is that very rarely will all 3 superstars all have an off-night. I believe this was a paraphrase of a Steve Kerr quote from last year. He said that if Stephen Curry has an off-night, KD will carry the offense; if KD has an off-night, Klay will shoot the lights out; and if Klay has an off-night, you can expect to be Curry out there sinking 3’s. The Thunder, did not employ this very simple concept at all today! Since Westbrook and PG were both having off-nights, the logical thing to do is to put the ball in Melo’s hands more. But the Thunder had Westbrook take 33 shots whereas Melo only took 17… There was a 3 minute stretch in the 4th quarter where I felt like Melo did not the touch the ball at all on offense and it was just Westbrook driving to the rim and missing 2 dunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blatant disregard for the hot hand did not continue after time-outs which leads me to believe OKC has a serious communication issue on offense. This is just me speculating, but is Billy Donovan afraid of telling Westbrook to give up the ball because he is the reigning MVP and OKC’s franchise player? Surely an NBA coach like him would not fail to realize Melo should get the ball more? And then, are Melo and PG uncomfortable telling Westbrook to give them more opportunities on offense because the other NBA stars who moved to new teams adapt to the star who has been there longer and not vice versa (KD adapting to Curry, CP3 adapting to Harden etc.)? Melo in New York would have surely called for ball with such a good shooting night, so what is stopping him from doing so in OKC? I don’t know what it is, but someone from OKC needs to help Westbrook realize that he should not try to do too much when he has so much superstar help around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, OKC doesn’t have an offense that connects Westbrook’s capabilities with that of PG and Melo. It is just an absolute shocker to me how OKC’s offense has Melo and PG in their respective baseline corners, waiting for Westbrook to run a pick-n-roll with Steven Adams and go downhill, only to either attempt a lay-up, alley-hoop or kickout to Alex Abrines and Andre Roberson! Yes, you heard me correct. From watching this game, I think Westbrook kicks out more to Alex Abrines and Andre Roberson than PG and Melo. I listened to a podcast criticizing how Billy Donovan is using PG and Melo as spot-up shooters. At this point, if PG and Melo do not get their share of the ball on Westbrook’s drives, they are even less than spot-up shooters… They are teammates appreciating Westbrook’s drives from the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Billy Donovan put Melo and PG both on baseline corners because that is the spot most slashers kick out to on a drive to the hoop. So Billy Donovan needs to get Westbrook to realize that Melo and PG are in those corners for a reason. Or he needs to get Roberson and Abrines to set down screens for Melo and PG and have them at the top of the key where Westbrook seems to kick the ball out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like these are very simple solutions to OKC’s offense that I am talking about. The truth is, THEY ARE! Which leaves me head-scratching why OKC does not have these simple axioms in place: 1) If you’re going to hero iso-ball, at least give it to the hot-hand. 2) Make sure Westbrook kicks the ball out to Melo or PG on his drives so they can actually do something off the dribble and not just stand around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty late so I’m going to end my first Medium article here. I was going to write about Philadelphia’s side of this game but I guess an OKC rant is enough for today. At this point, I would say the better narrative for OKC is “NBA fans have figured out that Melo and PG are not being fully utilized in the offense. Have Westbrook pass to them more! Period!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one truly thinks about it, OKC’s offensive flaws are as simple as that. It’s more a matter of communication and implementing them than anything else. Maybe it’s hard to implement a ball-share system when OKC has been doing a Westbrook-centric offense for so long. Anyhow, good luck OKC, because I really want to see the full potential of your offence :D&lt;/p&gt;
