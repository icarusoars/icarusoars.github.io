  This template is for showing the data science skills semantic tree.
  As Elon Musk has famously said, it is important to view knowledge as
  a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles,
  i.e. the trunk and the big branches, before you get into the leaves/details
  or there is noting for them to hang onto.
